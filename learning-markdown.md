# Mark Down For First Starters

### Purpose:
The premise of markdown is to formulate the layout of our GitHub web pages.

### What is mark down?
Mark downs are various symbles and lettering that will customize your page such as the following:

- **Headings**  

Headings are annotated with the # symbol and anything that follows will become large bold words.

- **Bold**

Words can be made bold with the ** ** and __ __ symbol with whichever wording between them.

- **Bulletin**

To make a bulletin or unordered list the - symbol will be used.

- **Ordered List**

To make an ordered list or numerical bulletin use numbers prior the text.

## Many other things are possible as well such as inserting cat images

# Introduction to Terminals

### How to start?

## Text Editor

To begin the process on has to first pick the desired text editor. A text editor is a website or software that allows you to write and manage text. Main things to look for in a text editor would be:

- Code completion (Suggest codes based off of user input) 
- Syntax highlighting (Makes text easier to read by adding different color to different text)
- The ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions (Extension will give functionality that wouldn't be had otherwise unless added)

## Command Line

Next would be learning the command line which gives you feedback based on what one inputs. A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

## Basic Navigation

Many tasks rely on being able to get to, or reference the correct location in the system. **Pwd** (which stands for Print Working Directory) tells you what your current or present working directory is.

Next is knowing what's there. The command for this task is **ls** (short for list).

In order to move around in the system a command called **cd** (which stands for change directory) is used.

## Files

Everything is a **file** and this command will obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is. Unless they're hidden abd in that case the command **ls -a** is used (list the contents of a directory, including hidden files).

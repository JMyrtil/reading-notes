# How to use JavaScript to Program

If one wants to program they must understand control flow. The term control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

# JavaScript Functions

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it. A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses (). Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables). Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition. Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked. Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

# JavaScript Operators

Assign values to variables and add them together, for example:

- let x = 5;         // assign the value 5 to x
- let y = 2;         // assign the value 2 to y
- let z = x + y;     // assign the value 7 to z (5 + 2)

The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable. For example, let x = 10.

The addition operator (+) adds numbers. For example:

- let x = 5;
- let y = 2;
- let z = x + y;

The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers. For example:

- let x = 5;
- let y = 2;
- let z = x * y;

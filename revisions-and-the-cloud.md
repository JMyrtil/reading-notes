# What is Git?

Simply put Git is a cloud where information can be saved and shared.

## What is Git Comprised of:
- Snapshots
- Local Operations
- Tracking Changes
- Loss of Data
- States

### What is a snapshot?

A snapshot would be the equivalent of a file save, but only once the commit command has been given.

### What is a Local Operation?

Local operation allows for the ability to work offline due to the project history being stored on a local disk.

### What is Tracking Changes?

Any file altered in Git is tracked by Git which allows Git to detect file corruption or loss of information in transit.

### What is Loss of Data?

Loss of Data is minimized buy the use of snapshot after a file has been committed

### What are States?

Their are two states, committed (Data is securely stored in a local database) and modified (File has been changed but not committed to the database).

# What is JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website.

## Core Features

Some core features of JavaScript would be the following:

- **Variable**

A variable is a named reference to a value. That way an unpredictable value can be accessed through a predetermined name. Variables are necessary to do anything interesting in programming. If values couldn't change, then you couldn't do anything dynamic, like personalize a greeting message or change an image displayed in an image gallery.

- **Comments**

Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments.

- **Operators**

An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).

- **Conditionals**

Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement.

- **Functions**

A function is a code snippet that can be called by other code or by itself, or a variable that refers to the function. When a function is called, arguments are passed to the function as input, and the function can optionally return a value. A function in JavaScript is also an object. Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code.

- **Events**

Real interactivity on a website requires event handlers. These are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response. The most obvious example is handling the click event, which is fired by the browser when you click on something with your mouse.

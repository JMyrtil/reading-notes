# My Growth Mindset

In general, I consider myself to be a neutral person. Even when I have biases, I tend to be on the more fair side. I try to be objective and rational in my assessments of situations and people, and I avoid making snap judgments or assumptions. I believe that fairness, justice, and equality are essential values that should guide our actions and decisions.

Although I try to be objective, I am still aware that I have my own biases and perspectives. Therefore, I am open to feedback and criticism, and I try to learn from my mistakes and shortcomings. I believe that self-reflection and self-awareness are crucial for personal growth and development.

I see curiosity and empathy as both equally important things. I am naturally curious about the world and people around me, and I enjoy learning new things and exploring different perspectives. I believe that curiosity can lead to greater understanding, creativity, and innovation. At the same time, I recognize the importance of empathy in understanding and connecting with others. I try to put myself in other people's shoes and see things from their perspective. I believe that empathy can foster compassion, kindness, and cooperation.

That being said, I tend to be closer to curiosity than empathy. I sometimes struggle to connect with people on an emotional level, especially if they have very different values or beliefs than mine. However, I am willing to listen and learn from others, even if I don't always agree with them.

One aspect of myself that I would like to improve is courage. Although I am not afraid to speak up when I see injustice or unfairness, I sometimes lack the confidence to take risks or pursue my goals. I am not a particularly outgoing person, and I tend to avoid confrontations or conflicts. However, I realize that courage is an essential quality for personal growth and achievement. I am working on developing my courage by taking small steps, such as speaking up more in meetings or trying new activities outside of my comfort zone.
